// The apple and oranges challenge is a beginner level challenge that basically
// wanted a calculation of how many apples and oranges fall onto Sam's house from the 
// respective trees. I solved the challenge using arrays and the for loop
// JavaScript method. Lesson learnt after research is that an optimized 
// solution would have been using the map function which produces more DRY code.
