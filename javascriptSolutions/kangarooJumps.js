The hackerrank challenged requires us to find out if two kangaroos in the circus actually get to meet 
at a specific position during the show.
The approach I used in this challenge is I initialized two parameters to store the sum
of both numbers.
I then compared the total of both parameters in a while loop with the condition that the two numbers were not
the same.
To help with the runtime, I put an upper limit of 10 000 000 000;
I also added some conditional statements to handle the base case scenarios.
